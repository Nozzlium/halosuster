# HALO SUSTER

A software to help nurses manage medical records. This project is developed using [Golang](https://golang.org), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com). We use [Gofiber](https://gofiber.io) as the main web framework for this project, [pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) as the main PostgreSQL driver and [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) for the migration.

To run this project, you need to have Docker installed on your machine. If you don't have Docker installed, you can download it [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). For Mac users, we recommend using [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/) to run your Docker containers since we have a better experience using it.

For the ease of local development, we utilize [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/) and [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) for hot-reloading. Docker Compose is installed by default if you are using either Docker Desktop or Orbstack on your machine. Please follow through the [Air's documentation](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to install Air on your machine and [Docker Compose installation manual](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) if you need to install it manually.

You can run the project using the following command:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Please make sure that the required environment variables was set before running the project. You can set the variables on the `.env` (`.env.dev` for local development) file.

You will also need to make sure that golang-migrate is installed on your machine. Please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) for more details.

At this stage, you will need to run the migration manually to create the tables on the database. **You won't need to do this manually in the next stage.** Please use the following command to run the migration:

```bash
migrate -database "postgresql://[USER]:[PASSWORD]@[HOST]:[PORT]/[DB_NAME]?connect_timeout=10&application_name=[APP_NAME]&sslmode=disable" -path db/migrate/primary/ up
```

To add a new migration, you can run the following command:

```bash
migrate create -ext sql -dir ./db/migrate/primary/ -tz "Asia/Jakarta" [MIGRATION_NAME]
```
